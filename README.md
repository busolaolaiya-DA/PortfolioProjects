CovidVaccinations – Vaccination records by location and date

Key Analyses

Total cases vs total deaths (death percentage)

Total cases vs population (infection rate)

Countries with highest infection rates

Continents and countries with highest death counts

Global daily cases and deaths

Population vs vaccination progress using rolling totals

SQL Concepts Used

SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY

Aggregate functions (SUM, MAX)

Joins

Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

Temporary tables

Views

Window functions (OVER, PARTITION BY)

Output

Cleaned and aggregated results ready for visualization

Reusable view (PercentPopulationVaccinated) for dashboards and reports

Use Case

Ideal for data analysis practice, portfolio projects, and building COVID-19 visualizations in tools like Power BI or Tableau.
